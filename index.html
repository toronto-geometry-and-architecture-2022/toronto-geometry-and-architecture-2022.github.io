    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    Toronto Geometry and Architecture (TGA) 2022 is the first in a series of collaborative workshop,
    organized by Dynamic Graphics Project and the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at University of Toronto, initiated by Professors Alec Jacobson, Maria Yablonina and Brady Peters. 
    This workshop is an opportunity for students from geometry processing and architectural computation research groups to communicate relevant issues in their fields. 
    It aims to fill the gap between geometric deep learning and architectural computation, and to promote collaborative research for social equity between these two fields.
